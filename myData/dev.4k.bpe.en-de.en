L@@ ast year I sho@@ wed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
But this under@@ st@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ i@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global cli@@ mate system .
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a rap@@ id fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
As you see , it exp@@ ands to the dar@@ k blu@@ e -- that &apos;s the an@@ n@@ ual ice in win@@ ter , and it con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is almost like blo@@ od , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ ats up the f@@ ro@@ zen ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a m@@ assi@@ ve amoun@@ t of f@@ ro@@ zen car@@ b@@ on which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ th@@ ane by mic@@ ro@@ b@@ es .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al amoun@@ t of global war@@ m@@ ing p@@ oll@@ ution in the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere , that amoun@@ t could d@@ ou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ al@@ low la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ th@@ ane is activ@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the Univers@@ ity of Al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
Video : Wh@@ o@@ a ! A@@ l G@@ ore : She &apos;s okay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enor@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ ats up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ n@@ ual m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much lar@@ ger than ever .
This is the K@@ an@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how se@@ a level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ b@@ ase ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a .
These flo@@ ws are incre@@ as@@ ing very rap@@ i@@ dly .
At the other end of the planet , An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ gest m@@ ass of ice on the planet .
L@@ ast mon@@ th scienti@@ sts re@@ por@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in ne@@ ga@@ tive ice bal@@ ance .
And w@@ est An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a c@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ l@@ ands , is partic@@ ul@@ arly rap@@ id in its m@@ el@@ ting .
That &apos;s equ@@ al to 20 feet of se@@ a level , as is Gre@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third lar@@ gest m@@ ass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the s@@ ource of dr@@ in@@ king water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
And the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are seri@@ ous .
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dra@@ ma@@ tic incre@@ ase in fir@@ es .
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an absol@@ ut@@ ely extra@@ ordin@@ ary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a completely un@@ su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pat@@ tern .
If you look at in the con@@ text of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 hours -- 25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans .
L@@ oo@@ k car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the area of the e@@ ast@@ ern P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic , from the Americ@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ est@@ ward , and on ei@@ ther side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a radi@@ cal de@@ ple@@ tion of ox@@ y@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
The big@@ gest single c@@ ause of global war@@ m@@ ing , along with de@@ for@@ es@@ tation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most seri@@ ous problem .
The United States is one of the two lar@@ gest em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plan@@ ts .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a se@@ a change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves pro@@ pos@@ ed .
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a poli@@ tical bat@@ tle in our country .
And the co@@ al indu@@ stri@@ es and the oil indu@@ stri@@ es sp@@ ent a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ing cle@@ an co@@ al , which is an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That ima@@ ge re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
A@@ ro@@ und Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as , in my home in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see , a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second lar@@ gest wa@@ ste stre@@ am in America .
This happened around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as .
One of the co@@ al industr@@ y &apos;s ads around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as was this one .

L@@ ast year at TED I gave an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ da@@ te on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ gest scienti@@ fic experim@@ ent ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence .
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the condi@@ tions that were pres@@ ent less than a b@@ illi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
This is the machine bel@@ ow Gen@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pic@@ tures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ gs inside de@@ t@@ ec@@ tors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ am@@ eter .
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the scale .
O@@ n the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It c@@ aus@@ ed im@@ men@@ se c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor .
In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ ump@@ h .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the big@@ gest che@@ er , or this , when someone went on@@ to Google and saw the front pa@@ ge was like that .
It means we made cul@@ tur@@ al imp@@ act as well as scienti@@ fic imp@@ act .
Ab@@ out a wee@@ k later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wir@@ es .
Th@@ ose wir@@ es car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and amp@@ s when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s , those wir@@ es can take that cur@@ r@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ net@@ s in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up sli@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 amp@@ s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ co@@ unter@@ ed electri@@ cal res@@ ist@@ ance .
This was the res@@ ult .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve when you con@@ si@@ der those mag@@ net@@ s wei@@ gh over 20 t@@ ons , and they mo@@ ved about a f@@ oot .
So we da@@ ma@@ ged about 50 of the mag@@ net@@ s .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or Ju@@ ly , and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blo@@ cks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents rei@@ g@@ ni@@ te the de@@ b@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the e@@ dge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an Engl@@ ish scienti@@ st , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ en@@ ding his pro@@ te@@ ge &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess experim@@ ents -- his pro@@ te@@ ge was M@@ ich@@ a@@ el Far@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so dan@@ ger@@ ous to the pro@@ g@@ ress of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a k@@ id , pla@@ ying with blo@@ cks .
As you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pic@@ k them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and sol@@ ve problems by under@@ standing and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scienti@@ st inspi@@ red by this u@@ ti@@ lity of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with physi@@ cal ob@@ jects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ att@@ ie , and my coll@@ abor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one m@@ ouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ ital f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could re@@ ach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physic@@ ally ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les .
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , a Si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ tive computer the size of a co@@ ok@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be mo@@ ved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their mo@@ tion , and they have a s@@ cre@@ en and a wir@@ el@@ ess radi@@ o .
M@@ ost import@@ an@@ tly , they &apos;re physi@@ cal , so like the blo@@ cks , you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing .
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of to@@ ols for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating dig@@ ital information .
And as these to@@ ols become more physi@@ cal , more a@@ ware of their mo@@ tion , a@@ ware of each other , and a@@ ware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and f@@ un inter@@ action st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple ex@@ am@@ ples .
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to show video , and if I ti@@ lt it in one direc@@ tion , it &apos;ll ro@@ ll the video this way ; if I ti@@ lt it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it back@@ wards .
And these inter@@ ac@@ tive por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ ware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interes@@ ted .
If they get sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed , they no@@ tice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and ti@@ lt .
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to reali@@ ze , was that we could use every@@ day ges@@ tures on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ int bu@@ ck@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that cent@@ ral one , where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oot , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties for education , like language , mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ ames where we want to give people the ability to try things quick@@ ly , and view the res@@ ults im@@ medi@@ ately .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation progra@@ m .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a m@@ ash@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le .
Bas@@ ically , in every ro@@ und you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly assi@@ g@@ ned let@@ ter on each Si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Then , after about 30 secon@@ ds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the Medi@@ a L@@ ab , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oot a video .
They really lo@@ ved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a tes@@ ter , down there on the right .
T@@ ur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just blo@@ cks .
Now , this is an inter@@ ac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
And we wanted to build a learning to@@ ol for language lear@@ ners .
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x , actually .
And he can bring new char@@ ac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the table that have that char@@ ac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the su@@ n out .
David M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll : Now he &apos;s br@@ ought a tra@@ c@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
G@@ ood job ! Yeah !
D@@ M : So by s@@ ha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and p@@ ut@@ ting them next to each other he can make the char@@ ac@@ ters inter@@ act -- Video : Wo@@ of !
D@@ M : inv@@ ent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive .
D@@ M : It &apos;s an op@@ en-@@ en@@ ded story , and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ en@@ cing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ ol that we &apos;ve built rec@@ ently , in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ unds like le@@ ad , b@@ ass and dr@@ ums .
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these so@@ unds into a sequ@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the pat@@ tern that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just b@@ ump@@ ing up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ able .
There are eff@@ ects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You at@@ ta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all eff@@ ects like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ u@@ me that app@@ ly to the entire sequ@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
Video : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by p@@ ut@@ ting a le@@ ad into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ range them into a seri@@ es , ex@@ t@@ end it , ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad .
Now I put a b@@ ass line in .
Video : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
Video : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ ums , so I can control the eff@@ ect live .
Video : D@@ M : I can spe@@ ed up the whole sequ@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other .
Video : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the b@@ ass for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion .
Video : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ range the sequ@@ ence while it pla@@ ys .
So I don &apos;t have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but I can impro@@ vis@@ e , making it longer or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , finally , I can fa@@ de the whole sequ@@ ence out using the vol@@ u@@ me Si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passi@@ on is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties that we &apos;re working to bring out of the l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ols for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ ital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look for@@ ward to talking with all of you .
I am a wri@@ ter .
W@@ ri@@ ting books is my prof@@ es@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ f@@ el@@ ong love and fas@@ c@@ in@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t exp@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ ently in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has c@@ aus@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relation@@ ship with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ently w@@ ro@@ te this book , this mem@@ o@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sa@@ tion , inter@@ national bes@@ ts@@ eller thing .
The res@@ ult of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
Li@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ ri@@ ed , and they say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to keep wri@@ ting for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , ex@@ cept for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ ager , when I first started tell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a wri@@ ter , I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based re@@ action .
And people would say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to have any suc@@ cess ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id the hum@@ i@@ li@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion will k@@ ill you ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams with your m@@ outh f@@ ill@@ ed with bit@@ ter ash of fa@@ il@@ ure ? &quot;
Li@@ ke that , you know .
The answer -- the sh@@ ort answer to all those questions is , &quot; Y@@ es . &quot;
Y@@ es , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even gu@@ ess at , like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to wri@@ ting , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wonder@@ ing about l@@ ately , is why ?
You know , is it ra@@ tional ?
I@@ s it lo@@ gi@@ cal that any@@ body should be exp@@ ected to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it speci@@ f@@ ically about cre@@ ative v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es that seem@@ s to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Li@@ ke my da@@ d , for example , was a chem@@ ical engine@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engine@@ ering any@@ body as@@ king him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a chem@@ ical engine@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ ering blo@@ ck , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fa@@ ir , chem@@ ical engine@@ ers as a group ha@@ ven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a rep@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ uri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We wri@@ ters , we kind of do have that rep@@ ut@@ ation , and not just wri@@ ters , but cre@@ ative people across all gen@@ r@@ es , it seem@@ s , have this rep@@ ut@@ ation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th century al@@ one , of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t liter@@ ally com@@ mit su@@ ici@@ de se@@ em to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he di@@ ed , last inter@@ view , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my books has kill@@ ed me a little more . &quot;
A@@ n extra@@ ordin@@ ary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and som@@ eh@@ ow we &apos;ve completely inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed and acc@@ ep@@ ted collec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ativ@@ ity and su@@ ff@@ ering are som@@ eh@@ ow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ul@@ tim@@ ately le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to live .
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my case -- in my sit@@ uation -- it would be very dan@@ ger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k p@@ ath of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , partic@@ ul@@ arly given the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ eck it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four dec@@ a@@ des of work left in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly lik@@ ely that anything I wri@@ te from this point for@@ ward is going to be ju@@ d@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish suc@@ cess of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly lik@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est suc@@ cess is behind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question be@@ comes , how ?
And so , it seem@@ s to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion , that the way that I have to work now , in order to contin@@ ue wri@@ ting , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ective psych@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ struc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dis@@ t@@ ance between me , as I am wri@@ ting , and my very natural an@@ x@@ i@@ ety about what the re@@ action to that wri@@ ting is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for mo@@ del@@ s for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emo@@ tional ris@@ ks of cre@@ ativ@@ ity .
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has led me to an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So st@@ ay with me , because it does cir@@ cle around and back .
But , an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that cre@@ ativ@@ ity came from human bein@@ gs back then , OK ?
People belie@@ ved that cre@@ ativ@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ it that came to human bein@@ gs from some dis@@ t@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able s@@ ource , for dis@@ t@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able reas@@ ons .
The Gre@@ e@@ ks f@@ am@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of cre@@ ativ@@ ity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates , f@@ am@@ ously , belie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ul@@ arly cle@@ ver individu@@ al .
They belie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gi@@ cal di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was belie@@ ved to liter@@ ally live in the w@@ alls of an arti@@ st &apos;s studi@@ o , kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f , and sort of inv@@ isi@@ bly ass@@ ist the arti@@ st with their work and would sh@@ ape the out@@ come of that work .
So bri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dis@@ t@@ ance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ struc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the res@@ ults of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent arti@@ st was prot@@ ected from certain things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism , right ?
If your work was bri@@ lli@@ ant , you couldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you .
If your work b@@ om@@ bed , not enti@@ r@@ ely your f@@ au@@ lt , you know ?
E@@ very@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ativ@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individu@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the universe ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal cre@@ atur@@ es who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of ra@@ tional human@@ ism , and people started to believe that cre@@ ativ@@ ity came completely from the self of the individu@@ al .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us , rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge er@@ ro@@ r .
You know , I think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ es@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the s@@ ource of all di@@ v@@ ine , cre@@ ative , unk@@ no@@ w@@ able , e@@ ter@@ nal my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much respon@@ si@@ bility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human p@@ sy@@ che .
It &apos;s like as@@ king somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the su@@ n .
It just completely war@@ ps and dis@@ tor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
And I think the pres@@ sure of that has been kill@@ ing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question be@@ comes , what now ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ ently ?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent under@@ standing about the relation@@ ship between humans and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y .
Ma@@ ybe not .
Ma@@ ybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of ra@@ tional human@@ is@@ tic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ ute spe@@ e@@ ch .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audi@@ ence who would ra@@ ise really le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate scienti@@ fic s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of , basically , fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their pro@@ jects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to p@@ ose is -- you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the utter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the cre@@ ative process .
A process which , as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not always beh@@ a@@ ve ra@@ tion@@ ally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ently where I met the extra@@ ordin@@ ary American po@@ et Ru@@ th St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was gro@@ wing up in r@@ ural Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she felt it coming , because it would s@@ ha@@ ke the ear@@ th under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like h@@ ell . &quot;
And she would run like h@@ ell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the pa@@ ge .
And other times she w@@ ouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be run@@ ning and run@@ ning , and she w@@ ouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on across the land@@ sc@@ ape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were m@@ om@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s run@@ ning to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pass@@ es through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would c@@ at@@ ch it .
She would c@@ at@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pa@@ ge .
And in these inst@@ an@@ ces , the po@@ em would come up on the pa@@ ge perf@@ ect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my cre@@ ative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my cre@@ ative process is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ abor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
But even I , in my mul@@ ish@@ ness , even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a s@@ ource that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identi@@ f@@ y .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our min@@ ds , but , in fact , might actually keep us s@@ ane ?
And for me , the best con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its , who I got to inter@@ view se@@ ver@@ al years ago on a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine assi@@ g@@ n@@ ment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary mo@@ dern arti@@ st , trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were tot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was dri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding along , and all of a su@@ d@@ den he hear@@ s this little fra@@ g@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspi@@ ra@@ tion often comes , el@@ usi@@ ve and tan@@ t@@ ali@@ zing , and he wan@@ ts it , it &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ape rec@@ order .
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of p@@ ani@@ cking , he just st@@ opp@@ ed .
He just st@@ opp@@ ed that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m dri@@ ving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can wri@@ te down a son@@ g right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more opport@@ un@@ e moment when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard C@@ oh@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work process changed after that .
No@@ t the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever .
But the process , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ ety around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was c@@ aus@@ ing nothing but tr@@ ou@@ ble , and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ abor@@ ation , kind of conver@@ sa@@ tion between T@@ om and the st@@ range , ex@@ ter@@ nal thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I heard that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already sa@@ ved me once .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of wri@@ ting &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve , &quot; and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ a@@ ster , the wor@@ st book ever w@@ ritten .
No@@ t just bad , but the wor@@ st book ever w@@ ritten .
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this project .
But then I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tri@@ ed it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d , &quot; L@@ isten you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t bri@@ lli@@ ant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my f@@ au@@ lt , right ?
Because you can see that I am p@@ ut@@ ting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the h@@ ell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep wri@@ ting any@@ way because that &apos;s my job .
And I would ple@@ ase like the rec@@ ord to re@@ f@@ lec@@ t today that I sho@@ wed up for my part of the job . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- cent@@ uri@@ es ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of Nor@@ th Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
They were always mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , because the dan@@ c@@ ers were prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ fic , right ?
But every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this .
It was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a su@@ d@@ den , he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fir@@ e with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
C@@ uri@@ ous hist@@ or@@ ical fo@@ ot@@ no@@ te : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed s@@ ou@@ th@@ ern S@@ pa@@ in , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ uri@@ es from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still hear in b@@ ul@@ l@@ f@@ igh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ c@@ o dan@@ ces .
In S@@ pa@@ in , when a per@@ for@@ mer has done something im@@ possible and ma@@ gi@@ c , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot; in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ ensi@@ ble , there it is -- a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tri@@ ck@@ y bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer h@@ im@@ self , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ ver@@ s that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary as@@ p@@ ects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just belie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able s@@ ource for some ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te por@@ tion of your life to be pass@@ ed along when you &apos;re fin@@ ish@@ ed , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it star@@ ts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is cer@@ tain@@ ly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will so@@ on be p@@ ub@@ lis@@ h@@ ed , as the dan@@ ger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated fol@@ low up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish suc@@ cess .
And what I have to sort of keep tell@@ ing myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be af@@ ra@@ id .
D@@ on &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . Just do your job .
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it , what@@ ever that might be .
If your job is to d@@ ance , do your d@@ ance .
If the di@@ v@@ ine , co@@ ck@@ ey@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us assi@@ g@@ ned to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ li@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your d@@ ance any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess .
I believe this and I feel that we must te@@ ach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , just for having the sh@@ e@@ er human love and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep sho@@ wing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ oh@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ jects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and disco@@ ver@@ ing new set@@ s of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually star@@ ting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing bi@@ ology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ ital co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of bi@@ ology with desig@@ ning and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bi@@ olog@@ ists have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s .
We &apos;ve tri@@ ed vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ i@@ mal comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ en@@ ced the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ ology into the dig@@ ital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ ital universe ? &quot;
This is the ma@@ p of a small organ@@ ism , M@@ y@@ cop@@ l@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ rep@@ lic@@ ate in the l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ aller gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c ma@@ p , it &apos;s rel@@ ativ@@ ely simple com@@ par@@ ed to ours -- tr@@ ust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ lik@@ ely that this would y@@ iel@@ d a living cell .
So we decided the only way for@@ ward was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to ask some of these most fundament@@ al questions .
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
C@@ an chem@@ is@@ try per@@ mit making these really large mol@@ ec@@ ules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical material .
So , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential p@@ ace .
O@@ ur ability to wri@@ te the gene@@ tic co@@ de has been moving pretty s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing , and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ages , in fact , star@@ ting with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experim@@ ents .
But it turns out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small piec@@ es of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for p@@ ut@@ ting these little piec@@ es together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ ors .
And this was our first at@@ tem@@ pt , star@@ ting with the dig@@ ital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small vir@@ us that kill@@ s bac@@ ter@@ ia .
We desig@@ ned the piec@@ es , went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DNA mol@@ ec@@ ule of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters .
The exc@@ iting ph@@ ase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ ia , and the bac@@ ter@@ ia started to read this gene@@ tic co@@ de , made the vi@@ ral partic@@ les .
The vi@@ ral partic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the cells and came back and kill@@ ed the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was talking to the oil industr@@ y rec@@ ently and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly under@@ st@@ ood that model .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a sit@@ uation where the so@@ ftware can actually build its own har@@ d@@ ware in a bi@@ ologi@@ cal system .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger : we wanted to build the entire bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic co@@ de -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to understand what the ac@@ tual comp@@ on@@ ents of a living cell are .
Design is cri@@ tical , and if you &apos;re star@@ ting with dig@@ ital information in the computer , that dig@@ ital information has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
When we first sequ@@ en@@ ced this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5 , the stand@@ ard of ac@@ cur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that orig@@ in@@ al sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
Par@@ t of the design is desig@@ ning piec@@ es that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es to build sm@@ aller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ que el@@ em@@ ents into this .
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ ink of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gene@@ tic co@@ de -- A , C , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters co@@ de for r@@ ough@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single let@@ ter desig@@ na@@ tion for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds .
So we can use the gene@@ tic co@@ de to wri@@ te out words , s@@ ent@@ ences , thou@@ ghts .
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ h it .
S@@ ome people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ et@@ ry .
We desig@@ ned these piec@@ es so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es ; there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together .
And we started making piec@@ es , star@@ ting with piec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es , then put set@@ s of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
At each st@@ age , we gre@@ w up these piec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a min@@ ute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of au@@ tom@@ ation .
So , this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball play@@ off .
When we get into these really large piec@@ es over 10@@ 0,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the mo@@ dern to@@ ols of mol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
We knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that bi@@ ology uses to re@@ pa@@ ir DNA that can put piec@@ es together .
Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organ@@ ism called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three milli@@ ons ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation .
You can see in the top pan@@ el , its ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome just gets blo@@ wn ap@@ art .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
These organis@@ ms can be tot@@ ally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am absol@@ ut@@ ely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous environment .
In fact , N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tual mic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h of the mol@@ ec@@ ule we built using these pro@@ cess@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the piec@@ es we put them in ; ye@@ ast pu@@ ts them together au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically .
This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on mic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h ; this is just a reg@@ ular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h .
It &apos;s such a large mol@@ ec@@ ule we can see it with a light mic@@ ros@@ c@@ ope .
These are pic@@ tures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second per@@ i@@ od .
So , this is the p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort while ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic co@@ de ; it &apos;s the lar@@ gest mol@@ ec@@ ule ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
It &apos;s over 3@@ 00 million mol@@ ec@@ ular wei@@ ght .
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ages just to pr@@ int this gene@@ tic co@@ de .
Well , how do we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ? How do we activ@@ ate this ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , with a vir@@ us it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ ter@@ ia .
It &apos;s also si@@ m@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just po@@ p out the nu@@ cle@@ us and po@@ p in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
Wit@@ h bac@@ ter@@ ia and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the cell , but we rec@@ ently sho@@ wed that we can do a comple@@ te transp@@ l@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
We pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al species -- r@@ ough@@ ly , these two are as dis@@ t@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , we di@@ ges@@ ted it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the prot@@ eins , and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very s@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated gr@@ ap@@ h@@ ics here .
The new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tri@@ ed to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther .
This is a maj@@ or mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome or a third one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gen@@ e chan@@ ging at a time have mis@@ sed much of bi@@ ology .
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called res@@ tri@@ ction enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ gest DNA .
The ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ pres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome as for@@ ei@@ g@@ n material , che@@ wed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a cell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .
It turned blu@@ e because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time , all the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of one species were l@@ ost and it conver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new species based on the new so@@ ftware that we put in the cell .
All the prot@@ eins changed , the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es changed ; when we read the gene@@ tic co@@ de , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the so@@ ftware of DNA around , change things quite dra@@ ma@@ tically .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ bri@@ an expl@@ os@@ i@@ on , where there &apos;s m@@ assi@@ ve new speci@@ ation based on this dig@@ ital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to n@@ ine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in con@@ text for myself : I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exis@@ ted in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding , provi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h , cle@@ an water , medi@@ c@@ ines , fu@@ el for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 b@@ illi@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hund@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of bi@@ ologi@@ cal pro@@ cess@@ es or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challen@@ ge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this material that ends up in the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere .
We now , from our disco@@ very around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the future .
The elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics industr@@ y only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that .
We &apos;re li@@ mit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a bi@@ ologi@@ cal reality and our imag@@ in@@ ation .
We now have techni@@ qu@@ es , because of these rap@@ id me@@ tho@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
We have the ability now to build a large ro@@ bot that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of pro@@ cess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ tim@@ i@@ ze pro@@ cess@@ es to produ@@ ce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produ@@ ce ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new v@@ acc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more mol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a s@@ cre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design so@@ ftware that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their gene@@ tic co@@ de looks like .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve seen rec@@ ently , cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experim@@ ent .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els that will be coming out rel@@ ativ@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ gar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different typ@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol .
But the only way we think that bi@@ ology can have a maj@@ or imp@@ act without fur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the cost of food and li@@ mit@@ ing its av@@ ail@@ ability is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cells to go down this ro@@ ad .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els in about 1@@ 8 months .
S@@ un@@ light and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ...
but in our disco@@ very around the world , we have all kinds of other me@@ tho@@ ds .
This is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6 .
It lives in the de@@ ep ocean , about a mi@@ le and a half de@@ ep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water tem@@ per@@ atur@@ es .
It takes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ ane using mol@@ ec@@ ular hy@@ dro@@ gen as its energy s@@ ource .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2 , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es , conver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this process .
So , in a sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole p@@ et@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ chem@@ ical industr@@ y -- Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? -- become a maj@@ or s@@ ource of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same to@@ ols to come up with inst@@ ant set@@ s of v@@ acc@@ ines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a d@@ ollar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
I think that can be changed by building com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ acc@@ ines in ad@@ v@@ ance .
Here &apos;s what the future may beg@@ in to look like with chan@@ ging , now , the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e , spe@@ e@@ ding up evolution with sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic bac@@ ter@@ ia , Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , ev@@ ent@@ ually , eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our go@@ al is just to make sure that we have a chan@@ ce to survi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quick@@ ly as I can , is some f@@ oun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we br@@ ought to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago .
This is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can ei@@ ther lo@@ c@@ ally or re@@ m@@ ot@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of vis@@ ual data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ ital phot@@ os here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and contin@@ u@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the ima@@ ges are .
M@@ ost of them are ordin@@ ary dig@@ ital c@@ amera phot@@ os , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ g@@ ress , and it &apos;s in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your s@@ cre@@ en at any given moment .
It &apos;s also very fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble archit@@ ec@@ ture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of n@@ on-@@ ima@@ ge data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ouse &quot; by Di@@ ck@@ ens . E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
To pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an ima@@ ge , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ ent@@ ation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al way to read an e-@@ book .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
This is a more re@@ alis@@ tic case , an issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very large ima@@ ge is the beginning of a sec@@ tion .
And this really gi@@ ves you the jo@@ y and the good experience of read@@ ing the real paper ver@@ sion of a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently mul@@ ti@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high res@@ ol@@ ution -- much hig@@ her than in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ atur@@ es of this car , you can see it here .
Or other mo@@ del@@ s , or even techni@@ cal speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those li@@ mit@@ s on s@@ cre@@ en real es@@ ta@@ te .
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be nec@@ ess@@ ary .
O@@ f course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this .
And this one I really won &apos;t sp@@ end any time on , ex@@ cept to say that we have things to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to this field as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ads in the U.S.
super@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on top of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al ima@@ ge .
So let &apos;s pul@@ l up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the We@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ eck it out .
This is a project called Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technologi@@ es .
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ v@@ ision research done by No@@ ah S@@ na@@ v@@ ely , a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent at the Univers@@ ity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by Ste@@ ve S@@ ei@@ t@@ z at U.@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft Res@@ ear@@ ch . A very ni@@ ce coll@@ abor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the We@@ b . It &apos;s power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through ima@@ ges and have this kind of mul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experience .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the ima@@ ges here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer v@@ ision al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed these ima@@ ges together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken ne@@ ar Gr@@ ass@@ i L@@ ak@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an Ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ments .
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to j@@ um@@ p stra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah &apos;s orig@@ in@@ al dat@@ a-@@ set@@ s -- this is from an early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e that we first got working this sum@@ mer -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly so ap@@ par@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we &apos;ve put up on the we@@ b@@ site .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l that was done enti@@ r@@ ely comp@@ ut@@ ation@@ ally from ima@@ ges sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ li@@ ck@@ r .
You just typ@@ e N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pic@@ tures of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , and of the c@@ amp@@ us and so on .
And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es repres@@ ents an ima@@ ge that was disco@@ vered to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ima@@ ges , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft .
It &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lots of different typ@@ es of c@@ amer@@ as : it &apos;s everything from cell@@ -@@ phone c@@ amer@@ as to prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of wei@@ r@@ d ones -- So many of them are oc@@ c@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
S@@ ome@@ where in here there is actually a seri@@ es of phot@@ ograph@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physi@@ cal view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment .
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive mem@@ ory , vis@@ ually , of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose phot@@ os become lin@@ ked , and they make something em@@ erg@@ ent that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts .
You have a model that em@@ er@@ ges of the entire Earth .
Th@@ ink of this as the long ta@@ il to Ste@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ ler &apos;s Vir@@ tual Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its become gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
Th@@ ei@@ r own phot@@ os are getting ta@@ g@@ ged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else en@@ ter@@ ed .
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my ph@@ o@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l su@@ d@@ den@@ ly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s phot@@ os , and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s-@@ mo@@ d@@ al and c@@ ros@@ s-@@ us@@ er social experience that way .
And of course , a b@@ y-@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tual mo@@ del@@ s of every interesting part of the Earth , collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te ima@@ ges and so on , but from the collec@@ tive mem@@ ory .
Thank you so much .
Chris An@@ der@@ son : Do I understand this right ? What your so@@ ftware is going to al@@ low , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pic@@ tures that are shar@@ ed by any@@ one across the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Y@@ es . What this is really doing is disco@@ ver@@ ing , cre@@ ating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between ima@@ ges .
It &apos;s doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the ima@@ ges .
And that gets really exc@@ iting when you think about the ri@@ chn@@ ess of the s@@ em@@ an@@ tic information a lot of ima@@ ges have .
Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for ima@@ ges , you typ@@ e in p@@ hr@@ ases , and the text on the we@@ b pa@@ ge is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tures ?
The amoun@@ t of s@@ em@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ chn@@ ess that comes out of that is really huge .
It &apos;s a cl@@ assi@@ c net@@ work eff@@ ect .
CA : T@@ ru@@ ly incredi@@ ble . Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the inten@@ se ple@@ as@@ ur@@ es of tra@@ vel and one of the del@@ igh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c research is the opport@@ unity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ ones p@@ ol@@ ish@@ ed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts .
Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ ond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ists still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absol@@ ute sense , but is just one model of reality ,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ b@@ ei@@ t suc@@ cess@@ ful@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through ini@@ ti@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ pr@@ ise us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que ca@@ dence of the son@@ g , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture .
And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ ert of Nor@@ th@@ ern K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the f@@ el@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma ,
E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fil@@ l you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ ri@@ tual life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ ologi@@ cal we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere .
And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere as being the s@@ um tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions br@@ ought into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere -- and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater rate .
No bi@@ olog@@ ists , for example , would d@@ are su@@ g@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of bi@@ ologi@@ cal di@@ vers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that , of course , is language los@@ s .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical r@@ ules .
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth for@@ est of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ ri@@ tual possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we s@@ it here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , ful@@ ly half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children .
They &apos;re no longer being tau@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , un@@ less something chan@@ ges , they &apos;re already de@@ ad .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your language , to have no way to p@@ ass on the wis@@ dom of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors or an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mis@@ e of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth r@@ ough@@ ly every two wee@@ ks , because every two wee@@ ks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , a b@@ rie@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being l@@ ost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Ta@@ ke , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who c@@ ogni@@ tiv@@ ely do not dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the col@@ or blu@@ e from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people dep@@ end .
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ tic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cal past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one prac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
They simply lis@@ ten and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak .
Or , one of the most fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mis@@ take .
They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y phot@@ ograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never seen anything t@@ wo@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al in their lives .
They pi@@ cked up these phot@@ ograph@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or , tri@@ ed to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conc@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other .
We tra@@ ced gene@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back ei@@ ght gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ an@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed getting old , so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous know@@ le@@ dge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
Th@@ ei@@ r h@@ unter@@ s could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing assi@@ g@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interes@@ ted in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties which were the fo@@ und@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t .
O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Chr@@ is@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Is@@ l@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , what@@ ever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a .
But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad .
So , the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
The spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to m@@ om@@ ent@@ ari@@ ly dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that b@@ rie@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; You whi@@ te people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about God .
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot;
And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the sp@@ ir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ unity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when c@@ at@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ an@@ t@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ th@@ ern Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
Des@@ c@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic m@@ assi@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the Sp@@ an@@ ish .
To this day , they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a ri@@ tual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s for 1@@ 8 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of ges@@ tation they sp@@ end in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the cos@@ m@@ ic -- or we might say the ec@@ ologi@@ cal -- bal@@ ance .
And at the end of this amazing ini@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ rise . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ape , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ stra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot;
They call themselves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ ung@@ er bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ si@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ape , we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ na@@ tiv@@ ely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ au and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ amp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and ri@@ tual , for@@ ged a tradi@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that mo@@ un@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tin@@ y will be a prof@@ o@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that res@@ ource or that place than a young k@@ id from Mon@@ tan@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a mo@@ un@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ es@@ ts of Bri@@ tis@@ h Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ es@@ ts exis@@ ted to be c@@ ut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ es@@ ts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ a@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a ini@@ ti@@ ation .
Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different reali@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their extra@@ ordin@@ ary disco@@ ver@@ ies . Ta@@ ke this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a phot@@ ograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What makes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal pot@@ ential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different s@@ our@@ ces : on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a seri@@ es of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is rather to have sort of blu@@ e ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e family
called P@@ sych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ in@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a se@@ a of electri@@ city . It doesn &apos;t create the dis@@ tor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ sol@@ ution of reality .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or , R@@ ich@@ ard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the psych@@ e@@ del@@ ic er@@ a with his disco@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t cl@@ assi@@ f@@ y these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally
because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ d@@ ase .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atur@@ es the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bi@@ o@@ chem@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the Co@@ f@@ an , has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dis@@ t@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one species .
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but som@@ eh@@ ow re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on .
Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technologi@@ cal innov@@ ations , but rather as the er@@ a in which we st@@ ood by the m@@ assi@@ ve des@@ tru@@ ction of both bi@@ ologi@@ cal and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ an@@ tly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ opp@@ ed being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gri@@ ty of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere . It is power , the c@@ ru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation .
W@@ her@@ ever you look around the world , you disco@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tures des@@ tin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dy@@ nam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of exis@@ ten@@ ce by identi@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ ond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ es@@ tation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved free in the for@@ est until a gener@@ ation ago ,
and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ it@@ u@@ de and pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s , where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seem@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the S@@ outh China Se@@ a , where the Jap@@ an@@ ese f@@ rei@@ gh@@ ters h@@ ang light in the hor@@ iz@@ on ready to fil@@ l their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est -- or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i ,
it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the disco@@ very of g@@ old .
Or if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of Ti@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research rec@@ ently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ de face of poli@@ tical dom@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the physi@@ cal ex@@ tin@@ ction of a people is uni@@ vers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the des@@ tru@@ ction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s uni@@ vers@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ters , c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ ateg@@ y .
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level .
I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Wes@@ tern China over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I under@@ st@@ ood the face behind the sta@@ tisti@@ c@@ s you hear about : 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ chen L@@ ama .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ an@@ tly kill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ asi@@ on .
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .
The s@@ is@@ ter who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education c@@ amp .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ g@@ res@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard l@@ abor .
The pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a cho@@ ice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ bra@@ ce a p@@ ol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of di@@ vers@@ ity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ ist , said , before she di@@ ed , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ wards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten there were even other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us ag@@ ri@@ culture , at which time we suc@@ c@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we created h@@ ier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y speci@@ ali@@ z@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago .
The mo@@ dern indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years old .
Now , that sh@@ al@@ low history doesn &apos;t su@@ g@@ gest to me that we have all the ans@@ wers for all of the challen@@ ges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the me@@ an@@ ing of being human , they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es .
And it &apos;s within that son@@ g that we will all re@@ disco@@ ver the possi@@ bility of being what we are : a ful@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous species , ful@@ ly a@@ ware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . And there are great m@@ om@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ ism .
This is a phot@@ ograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ th@@ ern ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ father .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and during the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ ced them into set@@ t@@ le@@ ments .
This old man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
The family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his to@@ ols .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge of it .
The run@@ ners of their s@@ le@@ ds were orig@@ in@@ ally made of fish w@@ r@@ app@@ ed in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ father was not in@@ tim@@ i@@ d@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the b@@ liz@@ z@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pp@@ ed outside , pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to fre@@ e@@ ze , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a b@@ la@@ de .
He put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the e@@ dge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally f@@ ro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d , he b@@ ut@@ cher@@ ed a do@@ g with it .
He sk@@ inn@@ ed the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ i@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to tot@@ al control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land lar@@ ger than C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together .
It &apos;s our new h@@ om@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ ory . They control all min@@ er@@ al res@@ our@@ ces .
A@@ n amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ e@@ k res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the planet , to reali@@ ze that they &apos;re not re@@ mo@@ te at all .
They &apos;re h@@ om@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They repres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ches of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ ams of these children , like the dre@@ ams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ ograph@@ y of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the Na@@ tional Ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c , finally , is , we believe that poli@@ tici@@ ans will never ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ish anything .
We think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ics -- -- we think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing in@@ stitu@@ tion in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ site every mon@@ th .
1@@ 5@@ 6 na@@ tions car@@ ry our tel@@ ev@@ ision chan@@ ne@@ l .
O@@ ur ma@@ ga@@ zin@@ es are read by milli@@ ons .
And what we &apos;re doing is a seri@@ es of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere where we &apos;re going to take our audi@@ ence to places of such cul@@ tur@@ al w@@ on@@ der that they cannot help but come away da@@ z@@ z@@ led by what they have seen , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , ther@@ e@@ fore , em@@ bra@@ ce gra@@ du@@ ally , one by one , the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ ology : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ verse way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic world
where all of the wis@@ dom of all pe@@ op@@ les can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to our collec@@ tive w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of m@@ ine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;ll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you mis@@ sed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all Wes@@ tern indu@@ stri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties .
And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this : if we are interes@@ ted in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ f@@ are of our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze individu@@ al fre@@ e@@ dom .
The reason for this is both that fre@@ e@@ dom is in and of itself good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , essen@@ ti@@ al to being human .
And because if people have fre@@ e@@ dom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to deci@@ de on our beh@@ al@@ f .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze fre@@ e@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze cho@@ ice .
The more cho@@ ice people have , the more fre@@ e@@ dom they have , and the more fre@@ e@@ dom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supp@@ ly that it w@@ ouldn &apos;t oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some ex@@ am@@ ples of what mo@@ dern pro@@ g@@ ress has made possible for us .
This is my super@@ market . No@@ t such a big one .
I want to say just a word about s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ars you could bu@@ y to make a very large number of your own s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chan@@ ce that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the stor@@ e has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the super@@ market is like .
And then you go to the con@@ su@@ mer elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers , C@@ D play@@ er , t@@ ape play@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single con@@ su@@ mer elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o systems .
We can con@@ struc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of cho@@ ice .
In other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ phone ser@@ vice you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You r@@ ented your phone . You didn &apos;t bu@@ y it .
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never bro@@ ke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ ones .
These are cell ph@@ ones of the future .
My fa@@ vor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ mer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chan@@ ce you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen that in your stor@@ e yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on , you will .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to walk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question .
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
The answer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to bu@@ y a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other as@@ p@@ ects of life that are much more sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same expl@@ os@@ i@@ on of cho@@ ice is true .
He@@ al@@ th care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you what to do .
In@@ stead , you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B@@ .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks .
B has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Do@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , Do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the res@@ ult is -- we call it &quot; pati@@ ent au@@ ton@@ om@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the respon@@ si@@ bility for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who kno@@ ws something -- nam@@ ely , the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who kno@@ ws nothing and is almost cer@@ tain@@ ly si@@ ck and th@@ us not in the best sh@@ ape to be making dec@@ isi@@ ons -- nam@@ ely , the pati@@ ent .
There &apos;s enor@@ m@@ ous mark@@ eting of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion dru@@ gs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t bu@@ y them .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t bu@@ y them ?
The answer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
S@@ ome@@ thing as dra@@ ma@@ tic as our identi@@ ty has now become a matter of cho@@ ice , as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identi@@ ty ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the morning , you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
Wit@@ h res@@ p@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and family , there was a time when the de@@ f@@ au@@ lt as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you could , and then you started having kids as so@@ on as you could .
The only real cho@@ ice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
No@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I te@@ ach wonder@@ ful@@ ly intelli@@ g@@ ent students , and I assi@@ g@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed , as@@ king themselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or not ? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed now ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed later ? Sh@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
All of these are con@@ sum@@ ing questions .
And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assi@@ g@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ ses .
And in@@ de@@ ed they should . These are important questions to answer .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ ess@@ ed , as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any place on the planet -- ex@@ cept the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell any@@ body about , where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works .
I &apos;m not tell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incredi@@ ble fre@@ e@@ dom of cho@@ ice we have with res@@ p@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a dec@@ ision , again and again and again , about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to wat@@ ch our k@@ id play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our l@@ ap@@ top , pres@@ um@@ ab@@ ly , on our l@@ aps .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every min@@ ute that we &apos;re wat@@ ching our k@@ id mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also as@@ king ourselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this e@@ ma@@ il ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s cer@@ tain@@ ly going to make the experience of your k@@ id &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and small things , material things and li@@ fest@@ y@@ le things , life is a matter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this .
That is to say , there were some cho@@ ic@@ es , but not everything was a matter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we now live in looks like this .
And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , &quot; y@@ es . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
All of this cho@@ ice has two eff@@ ects , two ne@@ ga@@ tive eff@@ ects on people .
One eff@@ ect , par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , rather than li@@ ber@@ ation .
Wit@@ h so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from , people find it very difficult to cho@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ ma@@ tic example of this : a study that was done of inv@@ est@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pl@@ ans .
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine got ac@@ cess to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the g@@ ig@@ an@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und company of about a million emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ places .
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed , rate of par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Why ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to cho@@ ose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to deci@@ de which f@@ und to cho@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row .
And then tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the dec@@ ision is so hard that they p@@ ass up sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er .
B@@ y not par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion .
So par@@ aly@@ s@@ is is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ic@@ es .
And I think it makes the world look like this . &#91; And la@@ st@@ ly , for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , Fr@@ en@@ ch , ble@@ u che@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93; You really want to get the dec@@ ision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the wrong mu@@ tual f@@ und , or the wrong s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
So that &apos;s one eff@@ ect . The second eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ s@@ is and make a cho@@ ice , we end up less sa@@ tis@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ult of the cho@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from .
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons for this .
is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to cho@@ ose from , if you bu@@ y one , and it &apos;s not perf@@ ect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different cho@@ ice that would have been better . And what happens is this imag@@ ined al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the dec@@ ision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ c@@ ts from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the dec@@ ision you made ,
even if it was a good dec@@ ision .
The more op@@ tions there are , the eas@@ ier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
S@@ econ@@ d , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opport@@ unity cos@@ ts . &quot;
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things dep@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are lots of al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves to con@@ si@@ der , it is easy to imagine the at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es of al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves that you re@@ ject that make you less sa@@ tis@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other av@@ ail@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this couple on the H@@ amp@@ t@@ ons .
Ver@@ y exp@@ ensi@@ ve real es@@ ta@@ te .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ?
&quot; Well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . E@@ very@@ body in my Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an nei@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ ends two wee@@ ks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opport@@ unity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
sub@@ tra@@ ct from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ ose , even when what we cho@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ fic .
And the more op@@ tions there are to con@@ si@@ der , the more at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ f@@ lec@@ ted by us as opport@@ unity cos@@ ts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of poin@@ ts .
It makes poin@@ ts about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly .
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things that may have lots of at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atur@@ es , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive .
Th@@ ird : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
I we@@ ar je@@ ans almost all the time .
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one f@@ la@@ vor , and you b@@ ought them , and they f@@ it like cra@@ p , they were incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , if you wor@@ e them and w@@ ash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it , easy f@@ it , rel@@ ax@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want b@@ ut@@ ton fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ ash@@ ed or ac@@ i@@ d-@@ w@@ ash@@ ed ?
Do you want them dis@@ tr@@ ess@@ ed ?
You want bo@@ ot c@@ ut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h . &quot; O@@ n and on he went .
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ pp@@ ed . And after I re@@ co@@ vered , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and I wal@@ ked out of the stor@@ e -- tru@@ th ! -- with the best@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . All this cho@@ ice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I felt wor@@ se .
Why ? I w@@ ro@@ te a whole book to try to expla@@ in this to myself .
The reason I felt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions av@@ ail@@ able , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one f@@ la@@ vor .
When they came in 100 f@@ la@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perf@@ ect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perf@@ ect .
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ected , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ected .
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produ@@ ce is less sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ults , even when they &apos;re good res@@ ults .
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ eting kno@@ ws this .
&#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you w@@ ouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The tru@@ th is more like this .
&#91; E@@ very@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93; The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a ple@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ ise .
No@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , indu@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , with perf@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be .
You will never be ple@@ as@@ an@@ tly sur@@ pris@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , have gone through the ro@@ of .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness is low exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ ograph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t set@@ tle .
But set@@ t@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
Fin@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fi@@ ed , and you ask why , who &apos;s respon@@ si@@ ble , the answer is clear : the world is respon@@ si@@ ble .
What could you do ?
When there are hund@@ re@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans av@@ ail@@ able , and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s respon@@ si@@ ble ?
It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
Wit@@ h a hund@@ red different kinds of je@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no exc@@ use for fa@@ il@@ ure .
And so when people make dec@@ isi@@ ons , and even though the res@@ ults of the dec@@ isi@@ ons are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the indu@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation .
I believe a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- not the only , but a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this expl@@ os@@ i@@ on of de@@ pres@@ sion , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so high , and then when they have to expla@@ in these experi@@ ences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at f@@ au@@ lt .
And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ mind you .
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . It is not true .
There &apos;s no question that some cho@@ ice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t fol@@ low from that that more cho@@ ice is better than some cho@@ ice .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amoun@@ t . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have long since pass@@ ed the point where op@@ tions impro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a poli@@ cy matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a poli@@ cy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ab@@ les all of this cho@@ ice in indu@@ stri@@ al so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about se@@ ver@@ al of them , where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ice .
Th@@ ei@@ r problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of mo@@ dern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , Wes@@ tern so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties .
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : Ste@@ ve Le@@ v@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ ensi@@ ve and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help .
It &apos;s a wa@@ ste of money .
What I &apos;m tell@@ ing you is that these exp@@ ensi@@ ve , comp@@ lic@@ ated cho@@ ic@@ es -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to so@@ c@@ ie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also , which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; Par@@ et@@ o-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess cho@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ ues us .
So to conc@@ lu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no li@@ mit@@ s &#93; You &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to read this car@@ to@@ on , and , being a s@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ ish@@ ed imag@@ in@@ ation , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , ho@@ we@@ ver , the more I came to the view that this fish kno@@ ws something .
Because the tru@@ th of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have fre@@ e@@ dom . You have par@@ aly@@ s@@ is .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
E@@ very@@ body needs a f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is almost cer@@ tain@@ ly too li@@ mit@@ ed -- perhaps even for the fish , cer@@ tain@@ ly for us .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , dis@@ a@@ ster .
Thank you very much .
